## About

Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner with a RestAPI backend and a reactive frontend application built in Vue for a pleasant user experience for the whole family.
This addon is based on the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/hkotel/mealie) from hay-kot.
This addon contains only the API, the frontend is installed with another addon.

1. Install this add-on.
1. Click the `Save` button to store your configuration.
1. Start the add-on.
1. Check the logs of the add-on to see if everything went well.
